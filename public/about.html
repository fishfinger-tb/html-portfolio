<p>You give me money. In return, I create the rawest
  looking website you've ever seen.
</p>

<p>I love art and challenging myself. With web development, I get to do both of those things.
  I'm kind of direct and to the point (Not really one to mince my words).
  If I offend you at any point because of that, you have my apologies in advance.
  Otherwise, I'm pretty easy to get along with.
</p>

<p>Now you're probably wondering why I even bothered to make this website.
  The truth is, it's for a project I'm doing as part of a web developer course.
  As I continue on my journey, I will be further updating this section as a 
  means of documenting how far I've come.
  Anyways thank you for reading this. Take care.
